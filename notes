CREATE -------
To create a table you need to specify the
  table name
  Primary key = partition key | optional sort key

aws dynamodb create-table \
--table-name movies \
--attribute-definitions \
AttributeName=year,AttributeType=N \
AttributeName=title,AttributeType=S \
--key-schema \
  AttributeName=year,KeyType=HASH\
  AttributeName=title,KayType=Range\
--provisioned-throughput \
  ReadCapcityUnits=10, WriteCapcityUnits=10
--endpoint-url http://localhost:8000

Components
  tables
    items
    atributes

partition key
sort key
  - effeciently store and retrieve items from the table.
    sort key example: [country]#[region]#[state]#[county]#[city]#[neighborhood]

primary keys
  1. partition key
  2. composite key => partition key and a sort key

To change the primary key create a new table and migrate the data to the new table.

*Locals Secondary Index
  Max of 5 local secondary indexs per table
  Sorts the data using the partition key and the index.
  Can only be changed during table creation.
  Consumes read and write capcity of base table
  Supports strongly or eventually consistent reads

*Global Secondary Indexs
  Queries span all partitions of the base table, and they can use different partition and sort keys from the base table.
  Can be changed at any time.
  Creates a new primary key and group of data to find data with. Like a new table. 
  Create up to 25 global secondary indexes per table.
  Each global secondary index has its own throughput settings
  Global secondary indexs support eventually consistent reads only
  
*AWS SDK interacting with the dynamo db like psql does with postgresql
